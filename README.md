# PlasmaCam
Are you trying to take photos of ultra-low light objects like plasma or stars or galaxies with an iPhone? This app offers a simple interface to control all the camera settings manually. You can take a batch of photos all with the same settings and save the blended result to your photo reel.

# Author's Notes
Thanks for taking an interest in this silly little app. I made it in a day while trying to take meaningful photos of the corona discharge phenomenon. If you're here, it's because you care about taking challenging photos. I'd love to collaborate!
